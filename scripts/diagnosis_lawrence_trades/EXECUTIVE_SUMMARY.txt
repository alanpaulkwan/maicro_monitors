EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: LAWRENCE EXECUTION DIAGNOSIS
================================================================================

OVERALL METRICS (using all aligned data):
  Total targets (from positions_jianan_v6): 13,187
  Targets with live data available: 2,244
  Matched (both target & actual): 1,872 (83.4%)
  Sign correct: 1,246 (66.6% of matched)
  Good execution (≤5% weight diff): 899 (48.0% of matched)

KEY FINDINGS:

1. DATA GAPS: 10,965 targets have no live_positions data (logging stopped)
2. UNEXPLAINED MISSING: 241 targets should have been traded but weren't
3. WRONG DIRECTION: 370 positions have opposite sign from target
4. BAD SIZING: 6 positions are >20% off from target weight

ROOT CAUSES OF MISSING TRADES:
  - logging_gap: 10,965 (96.9%)
  - unknown: 241 (2.1%)
  - weekend: 109 (1.0%)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Fix logging gaps (Nov 5-30 has no data)
  2. Investigate 'unknown' missing trades
  3. Review sign-wrong cases (might be T+1 vs T+2 offset issue)
  4. Tighten execution to reduce >20% weight deviations
